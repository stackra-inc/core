/**
 * @file realtime.events.ts
 * @module @stackra/contracts/events
 * @description Event names emitted by `@stackra/realtime` on the
 *   `EVENT_EMITTER` bus.
 *
 *   Constants live in contracts so cross-package consumers (dashboards,
 *   audit logs, error trackers) can subscribe without depending on the
 *   realtime package directly.
 *
 *   @example
 *   ```typescript
 *   import { REALTIME_EVENTS } from '@stackra/contracts';
 *
 *   @OnEvent(REALTIME_EVENTS.DISCONNECTED)
 *   onDisconnect(payload: { connection: string; reason: string }) {
 *     metrics.increment('realtime.disconnect', payload);
 *   }
 *   ```
