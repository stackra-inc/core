/**
 * @file logger.events.ts
 * @module @stackra/contracts/events
 * @description Event name constants emitted by `@stackra/logger`.
 *
 *   Emitted by `LoggerManager` on the optional event bus (wired via
 *   `setPubSub()` at module init). Useful for shipping logs to
 *   secondary sinks (Slack, Sentry, Loki) without re-registering
 *   reporters.
 *
 *   @example
 *   ```typescript
 *   import { LOGGER_EVENTS } from '@stackra/contracts';
 *
 *   @OnEvent(LOGGER_EVENTS.MESSAGE_LOGGED)
 *   onMessageLogged(payload: { level: string; message: string }) {
 *     if (payload.level === 'error') slack.notify(payload.message);
 *   }
 *   ```
