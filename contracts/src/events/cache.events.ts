/**
 * @file cache.events.ts
 * @module @stackra/contracts/events
 * @description Event name constants emitted by `@stackra/cache`.
 *
 *   These events are emitted by `CacheService` on the
 *   `EVENT_EMITTER` bus when an emitter is registered (the service
 *   injects it as `@Optional`, so fail-soft when not configured).
 *
 *   The constants live in contracts because cross-package consumers
 *   (metrics collectors, audit log writers, dashboards) need to
 *   subscribe to these names without depending on `@stackra/cache`
 *   directly.
 *
 *   @example
 *   ```typescript
 *   import { CACHE_EVENTS } from '@stackra/contracts';
 *
 *   @OnEvent(CACHE_EVENTS.MISS)
 *   onCacheMiss(payload: { key: string; store: string }) {
 *     metrics.increment('cache.miss', { store: payload.store });
 *   }
 *   ```
