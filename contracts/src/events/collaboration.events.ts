/**
 * @file collaboration.events.ts
 * @module @stackra/contracts/events
 * @description Wire-message event names for `@stackra/collaboration`.
 *
 *   These names are used both on the shared `EVENT_EMITTER` bus and
 *   on each room-scoped transport (BroadcastChannel, Reverb, etc.) as
 *   the message `type` field, so they're kept in imperative form
 *   ("cursor-move", "thread-create") to match Liveblocks/Yjs-style
 *   command-message conventions.
 *
 *   Constants live in contracts so cross-package consumers (audit
 *   loggers, presence dashboards, analytics collectors) can subscribe
 *   without depending on the collaboration package directly.
 *
 *   Payload shapes (documented on the collaboration package):
 *     - `CURSOR_MOVE`    — `{ roomId, member, position }`
 *     - `CURSOR_REMOVE`  — `{ roomId, memberId }`
 *     - `TYPING_START`   — `{ roomId, member, threadId? }`
 *     - `TYPING_STOP`    — `{ roomId, member, threadId? }`
 *     - `THREAD_CREATE`  — `{ roomId, thread }`
 *     - `THREAD_REPLY`   — `{ roomId, threadId, message }`
 *     - `THREAD_RESOLVE` — `{ roomId, threadId, resolvedBy }`
 *     - `THREAD_DELETE`  — `{ roomId, threadId }`
