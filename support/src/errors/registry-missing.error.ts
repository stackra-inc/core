 *   in the registry.
 *
 *   `get()` returns `undefined` for missing keys (matching `Map.get`)
 *   — use that when the caller is prepared to handle absence.
 *   `getOrFail()` is the strict variant for code paths where the
 *   value is a hard prerequisite (resolver, dispatcher, …) and
 *   silently returning `undefined` would propagate a null-reference
 *   error further downstream.
 *
 *   @see {@link BaseRegistry.get} for the nullable variant.
 *   @see {@link BaseRegistry.getOrFail} for the strict variant.
