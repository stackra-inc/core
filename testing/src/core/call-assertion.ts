/**
 * @file call-assertion.ts
 * @module @stackra/testing/core
 * @description Fluent, self-throwing assertion DSL for `Assertable`.
 *
 *   The predicate API on `Assertable` (`wasCalled`, `wasCalledWith`,
 *   `callCount`) returns booleans/numbers — you pair them with your
 *   test framework's `expect(...)` matchers. The DSL exposed here is
 *   the *chainable* alternative: build up a filter with `.with(...)`
 *   and terminate with `.once()` / `.times(n)` / `.never()` / etc.
 *   Failures throw a rich `Error` with a diff of expected vs actual
 *   calls — no `expect()` wrapper needed.
 *
 *   ```ts
 *   mock.$.assertCalled('getUser').with('42').once();
 *   mock.$.assertCalled('save').times(3);
 *   mock.$.assertCalled('close').never();
 *   ```
